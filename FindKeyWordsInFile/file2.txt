The Mona Lisa is a half-length portrait painting by the Italian artist Leonardo da Vinci. It is considered an archetypal masterpiece of the Italian Renaissance, and has been described as "the best known, the most visited, the most written about, the most sung about, the most parodied work of art in the world". The painting's subject is Lisa Gherardini, a noblewoman from Florence, and is believed to have been painted between 1503 and 1506. It is currently housed in the Louvre Museum in Paris, France.
