The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
A day without laughter is a day wasted.
In the middle of every difficulty lies opportunity.
It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop.
I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work.
Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.
Believe you can and you're halfway there.
The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing.
To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.
I would rather die of passion than of boredom.
